# ISU-CE
Cold Electronics Testing for the DUNE experiment at Iowa State University. Specifically focused on functional testing and analysis of the P3 LArASICs in LN2 and in room temperature.


### Gain, Pedestal RMS and Mean
From functional tests ran using the femb python setup, we can evaluate output parameters from the tests. Three primary parameters of the ASICs that have been shown to be a good indicator of ASIC performance include the pedestal Mean and RMS, and the Gain. For the functional test, pulses are sent, shaped, and digitized by the on-board electronics. The voltage rises in a stair-step fashion - as a result, the amplitude of the sampling pulses increases. The accumulation of the pulses into a .root file 'creates' a waveform of pulses. There are a total of 35 voltage increases, each corresponding to a 'Subrun'. Subrun[0] denotes no injected pulses, and thus indicates the baseline value for a given channel on a given ASIC. This baseline value is the Pedestal Mean. The spread in the pedestal for a given channel is the Pedestal RMS, and represents the noise of the electronics (board and ASIC). The Gain is calculated by analyzing the waveform (cummulation of pulses), extracting the inverse slope, and converting to proper units of (e-/adc). The Gain is used to determine if the ASIC 'passes' or 'fails'. The Gain is a rough representation of the linearity of the ASICs, as well.
