# ISU-CE
### Cold Electronics Testing for the DUNE experiment at Iowa State University. Focused on functional testing, analysis, and the mechanical integrity of the LArASICs in LN2 and in room temperature.

_____

The Functional Analysis Folder contains both the standard femb software parameters (RMS, Mean, Gain, and ENC) as well as expanded parameters like Linearity and Pulse Characteristics. The code found in these folders were developed to analyze edited .list and .dat files created directly by the femb testing software developed for the P3 LArASICs for ProtoDUNE (found here, femb_python: https://github.com/DUNE/femb_python). An example of the edited files for individual ASICs are found in the folders.
_____

The SAM Analysis folder contains all code infrastructure for the correlation analysis. The correlation analysis quantifies and identifies anti-correlation regions observed using SAM.
_____

The codes and scripts used for extracting the .ROOT files created using the femb software for QC testing are provided under the Functional Performance Analysis folder, as well as a description on how to run the scripts.
